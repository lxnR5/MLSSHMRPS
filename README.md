# Decision Tree Based Machine Learning Framework for Early Risk Prediction in Soldier Health Monitoring Using IoT and LoRa Communication

## Overview

This project presents a real-time Soldier Safety Monitoring and Risk Prediction System that combines IoT sensors, LoRa communication, GPS tracking, and Machine Learning to continuously monitor a soldier's physiological condition, movement, environmental parameters, and location.

The system collects vital health and motion data using multiple sensors connected to an ESP32-based transmitter node. The data is transmitted wirelessly through LoRa technology to a receiver node and visualized on a Flask-based web dashboard. A Decision Tree Machine Learning model predicts the soldier's health state and provides early warnings for potential risks.
